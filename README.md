# Hybrid-quantum-solver-vs-classical-solver
Here is an optimization problem featuring binary decision variables. We conducted several runtime analyses for varying numbers of decision variables. For quantum solving, we utilized the 'LeapHybridCQMSampler,' and for classical solving, we utilized the CPLEX in qiskit. Our results demonstrate that hybrid quantum solvers exhibit a constant trend, whereas CPLEX becomes unresponsive for higher numbers of decision variables. We have attached a graph displaying the different runtimes. ([Image URL](https://github.com/ladan-salimi/Hybrid-quantum-solver-vs-classical-solver/blob/main/Quantum-Cplex.png
